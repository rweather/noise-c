\page example_echo Using Noise-C: Client/Server Echo Example

\tableofcontents

This page describes how to use Noise-C to create a simple client/server
echo system.  This example uses the same wire protocol as the echo example from
<a href="https://github.com/centromere/cacophony#example-code">cacophony</a>,
for testing interoperability between Noise implementations.

The source code for the example is under the <tt>examples/echo</tt>
directory in the Noise-C repository.  There are three programs that
make up the example: <tt>echo-client</tt>, <tt>echo-server</tt>,
and <tt>echo-keygen</tt>.  Here we describe the main points of the
client code to demonstrate how to use Noise-C.  The server side is similar.

\section example_echo_client Creating a Noise-C client application

\subsection example_echo_create_handshake Creating the HandshakeState

The first step in using a HandshakeState is to create it with either the
noise_handshakestate_new_by_name() or noise_handshakestate_new_by_id()
function:

\dontinclude echo-client.c
\skip NoiseHandshakeState *handshake;
\until NoiseHandshakeState
\skip noise_handshakestate_new_by_name
\until }

Here the "protocol" variable is the name of the Noise protocol,
such as "Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s".  Because we are writing a
client, the role is \ref NOISE_ROLE_INITIATOR.  The server side uses
\ref NOISE_ROLE_RESPONDER instead.

If an error occurs, the noise_perror() function can be used to print a
simple message to the standard error output in the same way as the
perror() function in C.  If you want to report errors through some
means other than the standard error output, you can use noise_strerror()
to obtain the error string directly.

For the rest of this page we will elide the calls to noise_perror() to
make it easier to understand the code snippets.  Error handling is very
important.  Noise sessions can fail for any number of reasons and
forgetting to check an error return could lead the application to
continue operating when it should stop.

When you no longer need the HandshakeState, the memory should be returned
to the system with noise_handshakestate_free():

\dontinclude echo-client.c
\skip no longer need
\skip noise_handshakestate_free
\until noise_handshakestate_free

\subsection example_echo_setting_keys Setting keys

After the HandshakeState object has been created, the next step is to
specify the prologue, pre shared key, and any public or private keys
that are needed for the handshake.  We start with the prologue:

\code
err = noise_handshakestate_set_prologue(handshake, prologue, prologue_len);
\endcode

We can also set the pre shared key (PSK) value:

\code
err = noise_handshakestate_set_pre_shared_key(handshake, psk, sizeof(psk));
\endcode

Next is the local client private key.  The function
noise_handshakestate_needs_local_keypair() tells us if the handshake
requires a local keypair.

Once we know if we need a keypair, we obtain the local Diffie-Hellman
key object using noise_handshakestate_get_local_keypair_dh() and set
the key with noise_dhstate_set_keypair_private():

\code
if (noise_handshakestate_needs_local_keypair(handshake)) {
    dh = noise_handshakestate_get_local_keypair_dh(handshake);
    key_len = noise_dhstate_get_private_key_length(dh);
    if (!echo_load_private_key(client_private_key, key, key_len))
        return 0;
    err = noise_dhstate_set_keypair_private(dh, key, key_len);
    ...
}
\endcode

In this case we are using a private key only.  Noise-C internally
derives the public key from the private key.  If we had both keys,
then noise_dhstate_set_keypair() can be used to set both.

The public key for the remote server is set in a similar fashion:

\code
if (noise_handshakestate_needs_remote_public_key(handshake)) {
    dh = noise_handshakestate_get_remote_public_key_dh(handshake);
    key_len = noise_dhstate_get_public_key_length(dh);
    if (!echo_load_public_key(server_public_key, key, key_len))
        return 0;
    err = noise_dhstate_set_public_key(dh, key, key_len);
    ...
}
\endcode

\subsection example_echo_run_handshake Running the handshake phase

At this point we have a fully configured HandshakeState object.
The next step is to start the handshake:

\code
err = noise_handshakestate_start(handshake);
\endcode

If there are any missing keys, then this function will fail with an error.

The handshake runs until there are no more packets to be processed.
Each step of the way, the noise_handshakestate_get_action() function
tells the application what needs to be done next.  The two most
important actions are \ref NOISE_ACTION_WRITE_MESSAGE and
\ref NOISE_ACTION_READ_MESSAGE, which indicates whether the application
should write or read the next handshake message.  A typical handshake
processing loop looks like this:

\code
for (;;) {
    int action = noise_handshakestate_get_action(handshake);
    if (action == NOISE_ACTION_WRITE_MESSAGE) {
        ...
    } else if (action == NOISE_ACTION_READ_MESSAGE) {
        ...
    } else {
        break;
    }
}
\endcode

When the application receives \ref NOISE_ACTION_WRITE_MESSAGE,
it should format the next handshake payload and call
noise_handshakestate_write_message() to prepare it for transmission.
The application then transmits what it was given over the transport.

When the application receives \ref NOISE_ACTION_READ_MESSAGE,
it should wait for an incoming message from the transport and pass
it to noise_handshakestate_read_message() to process it and recover
the payload.

This process continues until the action is either \ref NOISE_ACTION_FAILED
or \ref NOISE_ACTION_SPLIT.  An action of \ref NOISE_ACTION_SPLIT
indicates that the handshake has completed successfully and the
application should move onto the data transport phase.

\subsection example_echo_run_transport Running the data transport phase

Once the handshake completes successfully, we can "split" the HandshakeState
into two CipherState objects, one for sending and the other for receiving:

\code
err = noise_handshakestate_split(handshake, &send_cipher, &recv_cipher);
\endcode

If the remote side provided its public key during the handshake,
then noise_handshakestate_get_remote_public_key_dh() and
noise_dhstate_get_public_key() can be used to retrieve it at this point.

The HandshakeState is now no longer required and we can discard it:

\code
noise_handshakestate_free(handshake);
\endcode

From now on, whenever the application has data to send, it calls
noise_cipherstate_encrypt() or noise_cipherstate_encrypt_with_ad()
on the sending CipherState, and then writes the resulting packet to
the transport.

Whenever the application receives an incoming packet, it calls
noise_cipherstate_decrypt() or noise_cipherstate_decrypt_with_ad()
on the receiving CipherState to decrypt it, and then processes the
contents if the decryption succeeded.

This process continues until the connection is terminated or an
error occurs.  The final step is to clean up the two CipherState objects:

\code
noise_cipherstate_free(send_cipher);
noise_cipherstate_free(recv_cipher);
\endcode

\section example_echo_using Using the echo example

This section describes how to use the echo example: how to generate keys,
how to start an echo server running, and how to connect to it using an
echo client.

\subsection example_echo_keygen Generating keys

The echo example uses a very simple key format.  Private key files are
binary data containing the 32 or 56 bytes of the private key, for Curve25519
and Curve448 respectively.  Public key files contain the base64 encoding of
the 32 or 56 byte public key values.

The <tt>echo-keygen</tt> example can be used to generate new keys or you can
use the keys from cacophony.  To generate a new key for Curve25519, you would
invoke the key generator as follows:

\code
echo-keygen 25519 client_key_25519 client_key_25519.pub
\endcode

The arguments are the curve type ("25519" or "448"), the name of the private
key file, and the name of the public key file.

The server needs a full set of keys, so here's how to generate them all:

\code
echo-keygen 25519 client_key_25519 client_key_25519.pub
echo-keygen 25519 server_key_25519 server_key_25519.pub
echo-keygen 448 client_key_448 client_key_448.pub
echo-keygen 448 server_key_448 server_key_448.pub
\endcode

\subsection example_echo_start_server Starting an echo server

A new echo server can be started with the following command:

\code
echo-server --key-dir=../keys 7000
\endcode

The server will look in <tt>key-dir</tt> for the keys that were generated
earlier.  If <tt>--key-dir</tt> is omitted, it defaults to the current
directory.

The pre-shared key value is loaded from the "psk" file in the key
directory.  It is assumed to be a 32 byte value encoded in base64.
Pre-shared keys are only used if the client selects them.

The final argument is the port number for the server to bind to.

\subsection example_echo_start_client Running the echo client

To use the client, specify the Noise protocol name, server hostname,
and server port number on the command-line:

\code
echo-client Noise_NN_25519_AESGCM_SHA256 hostname 7000
\endcode

In this case we are using the "NN" pattern which does not require any
additional local or remote static keys.  If keys are required, they can
be provided via options:

\code
echo-client --client-private-key=client_key_448 \
            --server-public-key=server_key_448.pub \
            Noise_NN_448_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b hostname 7000

echo-client --client-private-key=client_key_448 \
            --server-public-key=server_key_448.pub \
            --psk=pskfile \
            NoisePSK_NN_448_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b hostname 7000
\endcode

After performing the handshake, the client reads lines of text from its
standard input and sends them to the server.  After each line, the client
will wait for a packet from the server and then will write its contents to
standard output prefixed by `Received`:

\code
Hello!
Received: Hello!
What day is it?
Received: What day is it?
\endcode

If the keys supplied to the client do not match those used by the server,
the connection will abort with a "MAC failure".

The <tt>--padding</tt> option can be supplied to cause the client to pad
all outgoing messages to a uniform size with random data.  The padding will
be stripped when the echo returns from the server.

The <tt>--verbose</tt> or <tt>-v</tt> option can be supplied to dump the
verbose packet contents that are transmitted or received.
The <tt>--fixed-ephemeral</tt> or <tt>-f</tt> option will force the client
or the server to use a fixed ephemeral key instead of the usual random
ephemeral key.  These options can help diagnose interoperability issues
between different implementations of the echo protocol.
